# Guidelines for DotnetLegacyMigrator

- All non-example projects, tests, and CI must target **.NET 9.0**.
- Keep the repository's `global.json`, project files, and GitHub Actions in sync with the .NET 9 SDK.
- Example projects may target different frameworks only when the legacy technology being demonstrated requires it.
